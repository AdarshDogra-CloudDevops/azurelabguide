# Build and Deploy Containers using Azure Container Instance

**Lab Duration:** 1 Hour  


## NOTE!!
**_Deploy all your resources into a resource group that ends with "01"_**


## Overview
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows users to quickly run containers directly on the Azure cloud without having to manage virtual machines or additional services like container orchestrators. It is a solution aimed at simplifying container operations by providing a serverless computing environment where you only pay for the compute resources that the container uses while it is running.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding Docker and Containerization  
- Building Docker images using **Docker Desktop** and pushing them to Azure Container Registry (ACR)  
- Deploying containerized applications using Azure Container Instances  

## Hands-on Lab

- **Exercise 1:** Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) 
- **Exercise 2:** Build and push a Docker image to ACR using **Docker Desktop**  
- **Exercise 3:** Deploy the containerized application using Azure Container Instances (ACI)  
- **Exercise 4:** Verify the deployment and access the Apache server
